## Tutorial Aims

- Benchmark the accuracy of the `newtonIcoFluid` coupled Newton-Raphson fluid
  solver for flow around an oscillating cylinder case.

---

## Case Overview

Wan and Turek[^wan2006] provided a numerical solution for the 2-D,
 incompressible, laminar, viscous flow past a circular cylinder that oscillates
 sinusoidally in an enclosed channel, where the mesh undergoes large motion.

### Solution Domain

The rectangular channel has a domain $[0, 2.2] \times [0, 0.41] \; \mathrm{m}$,
 and the cylinder is initially located at $(1.1, 0.2)\; \mathrm{m}$ with respect
 to the lower left corner of the domain (figure below).

### Governing Equations

When the cylinder patch (`cylinder`) begins oscillating, the surrounding
 mesh deforms, and the volume of individual cells changes throughout the
 simulation. To deal with the moving mesh, an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian
 (ALE) approach is adopted. The continuity and momentum equations in arbitrary
 Lagrangian-Eulerian form are:
$$
\int_{\Omega(t)} \nabla \cdot \mathbf{U} \mathrm{d}V = 0,
$$

$$
  \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \int_{\Omega(t)} \mathbf{U} \mathrm{d}V
\+ \int_{\Omega(t)} \nabla \cdot
  \big[\mathbf{U} \otimes (\mathbf{U} - \mathbf{U}_{\mathrm g})\big] \mathrm{d}V
\- \int_{\Omega(t)} \nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{U} \mathrm{d}V
\- \int_{\Omega(t)} \nabla p \mathrm{d}V
\= 0,
$$

where $\mathbf{U}$ denotes the fluid velocity, $p$ is the kinematic pressure,
 $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid, $\rho$ represents the fluid
 density, and $\mathbf{U}_{\mathrm g}$ is the grid (mesh) velocity. The grid
 velocity $\mathbf{U}_g$ is obtained using a pseudo-solid approach, where the
 volume swept by the internal faces is calculated in a way that the space
 conservation law, also known as the grid conservation law, is automatically
 satisfied:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \int_{\Omega(t)} \mathrm{d}V
\- \int_{\Omega(t)} \nabla \cdot \mathbf{U}_{\mathrm g} \mathrm{d}V = 0.
$$

```note
In the Arbitrary Lagrangianâ€“Eulerian formulation, if $\mathbf{U}_{\mathrm{g}} =
 0$, we recover the Eulerian description (static mesh). If
 $\mathbf{U}_{\mathrm{g}} = \mathbf{U}$, we obtain the Lagrangian description
 (mesh moves with fluid particles). Any other case corresponds to the ALE
 description.
```

### Cylinder (Boundary) Motion

The displacement of points on the `cylinder` patch, with an initial cylinder
 center at $(x_0, y_0) = (1.1, 0.2)$ (relative to the lower-left corner of the
 domain), are given by:
$$
\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{cyl}}
\= \left(\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{cyl}_0}^x + A \sin(\omega t)\right) \mathbf{i}
\+ \mathbf{x}_{{\mathrm cyl}_0}^y \mathbf{j},
$$

where $t$ is time, $A = 0.25\; \mathrm m$ is the oscillation amplitude, $\omega
 = 2\pi f$ is the angular velocity, $f = 0.25\; \mathrm Hz$ is the oscillation
 frequency, and $\mathbf{x}_{{\mathrm cyl}_0}$ is the initial location points on
 the `cylinder` patch, where $\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{cyl}_0}^x $ and
 $\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{cyl}_0}^y $ are its $x$ and $y$ components respectively.
 This motion is specified in the `0/pointDisplacement` file.

### Boundary condition

A no-slip moving wall boundary condition, $\mathbf{U} = \mathbf{\bar{U}}\;
 \mathrm{m/s}$, and a zero-pressure-gradient condition, ${\partial p}/{\partial
 n} = 0$, are applied on all solid surfaces, where $\mathbf{\bar{U}} =
 \mathbf{0}$ on the outer boundaries and is given as the velocity of the mesh
 motion on the cylinder. The fluid is initially at rest $\mathbf{U}_0 =
 \mathbf{0}\; \mathrm{m/s}$. As all pressure boundaries are of gradient type,
 the pressure field is defined up to a constant. To deal with this in the
 current case, the pressure in one cell of the domain, close to the point
 specified by the dictionary entry `system/fvSolution.PIMPLE.pRefPoint`, is
 fixed to $0\; \mathrm{Pa}$.

The `left` and `right` patches are assigned a zero displacement condition, while
 the `up` and `down` patches use a _slip_ boundary condition, which constrains
 motion in the normal direction, $\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{g}} \cdot \mathbf{n} = 0
 \; \mathrm{m}$, while allowing tangential displacement with the same
 displacement as the nearest interior cell, satisfying ${\partial (\mathbf{x}_g
 \cdot \mathbf{t})}/{\partial n} = 0$, where $\mathbf{x}_g$ represents the
 coordinate of a point on the patch.

![Initial and boundary conditions](./images/initial_and_boundary_condition.png)

The slip boundary condition preserves the initial orthogonality and minimises
 mesh skewness during the cylinder's horizontal oscillations: the `up` and
 `down` boundaries allow tangential sliding, while the mesh to the left and
 right of the cylinder undergoes compression and expansion like an accordion,
 preventing excessive distortion and maintaining quality throughout the domain.
 For example, the figure below shows a structured quadrilateral mesh
 (`MESH_LEVEL=2`) at time $t = 3.00 \;\mathrm{s}$, which corresponds to the
 farthest cylinder can move toward the left ($\sin(2 \pi f t) = -1$ ).
$$
x_{\text{cell}}\big|_{t=3.0\mathrm s}
= A \sin(2 \pi f t)
= 0.25 \times \sin(2 \times 0.25 \times \pi \times 3 )
= -0.25 \;\mathrm{m}
$$

At this instance of time, and similarly at $t = 9.00 \mathrm{s}$, the mesh has
 the highest deformation.

![Slip boundary condition](./images/mesh_t_3.00s.png)

Also, note that since the `cylinder` patch is moving, we need to use the motion
 boundary condition, `newMovingWallVelocity`, in the `0/U` file.

```foam
boundaryField
{
    cylinder
    {
        type            newMovingWallVelocity;
        value           uniform (0 0 0);
    }
    ...
}
```

```note
Note that newMovingWallVelocity is a version of movingWallVelocity, where
 boundary non-orthogonal corrections are included.
```

### Constant Properties

The fluid is Newtonian with the kinematic viscosity, $\nu = \mu / \rho = 1
 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{m}^2/\mathrm{s}$, and density, $\rho = 1
 \mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^3$, (needed by `newtonIcoFluid` fluid model) specified
 in `constant/transportProperties`

```foam
transportModel  Newtonian;

rho             rho [1 -3 0 0 0 0 0] 1;
nu              nu  [0 2 -1 0 0 0 0] 1e-3;
```

Since the flow is laminar, `constant/turbulenceProperties` contains:

```foam
simulationType  laminar;
```

Gravity has no effect in this problem; therefore, the `constant/g` file
 contains:

```foam
dimensions      [0 1 -2 0 0 0 0];
value           (0 0 0);
```

In the `constant/physicsProperties` file, we select the fluid analysis as the
 physics type.

```foam
type fluid;
```

Next, we select a fluid model and specify its coefficients in the
`constant/fluidProperties` file.

```foam
fluidModel ${FLUID_MODEL:-newtonIcoFluid}; // or pimpleFluid

pimpleFluidCoeffs
{}

newtonIcoFluidCoeffs
{
    // Trottenberg gives 1/16 for Stokes flow
    omega           [0 -2 1 0 0 0 0] 0.625;
    localReRef      1;
    omegaExponent   1.0;
    alphaU          1.0;

    // Set the pressure to zero at the centre cell
    pRefPoint       (0.5 0.2 0);
    pRefValue       0.0;

    // PETSc options file used by PETSc SNES
    optionsFile     petscOptions.lu;
}
```

```note
Coefficients for `pimpleFluid` should be specified in the
 `system/fvSolution.PIMPLE` dictionary.
```

```tip
`${FLUID_MODEL:-newtonIcoFluid}` uses shell parameter expansion, meaning it will
 insert the value of the environment variable `FLUID_MODEL` if it's non-empty,
 or fall back to `newtonIcoFluid` if empty. This allows us to set `fluidModel`
 dynamically without editing the file and by simply setting the environment
 variable before running the case, e.g., `FLUID_MODEL=pimpleFluid solids4Foam`
 or `FLUID_MODEL=pimpleFluid ./Allrun`
```

## Initial Mesh

Four types of meshes are availabe in the case:

- Structured quadrilateral uniform mesh (`MESH=QUAD`),
- Structured quadrilateral graded mesh (`MESH=QUAD_GRADED`),
- Unstructured triangular mesh (`MESH=TRI`),
- Unstructured polyhedral mesh (`MESH=POLY`).

As an example, uniform and graded structured hexagonal grids at three different
 mesh density levels are shown in the following figures:

![Various mesh density levels of the uniform structured mesh: (a) `MESH_LEVEL=1`,
 (b) `MESH_LEVEL=2`, (c) `MESH_LEVEL=3`.](./images/structured_uniform_hex_meshes.png)

An example of an unstructured polyhedral mesh generated using a combination of
 Gmsh and `polyDualMesh` is shown below.

![An example of unstructured graded polyhedral mesh.](./images/unstructured_graded_poly_mesh.png)

---

## Mesh Motion

The dynamics mesh details are specified in `constant/dynamicMeshDict`, where
 the type of  dynamic mesh is set to `dynamicMotionSolverFvMesh`, which uses a
 mesh motion solver to compute the mesh motion based on a prescribed motion.

```foam
dynamicFvMesh       dynamicMotionSolverFvMesh;
motionSolverLibs    (fvMotionSolvers);
```

In this case, among other mesh motion solvers implemented in OpenFOAM, we use
 `displacementLaplacian`, which is a diffusion-based solver that smoothly
 propagates motion throughout the domain.

```foam
motionSolver        displacementLaplacian;
```

It solves a Laplace equation for cell displacement (`cellDisplacement`)
 field (stored at cell centers),

$$
\nabla \cdot \left( \Gamma \nabla (\Delta \mathbf{X}_{\text{cell}}) \right) = 0,
$$

where $\Delta \mathbf{X}_{\text{cell}}$ is the cell displacement field
 (`cellDisplacement`) and $\Gamma$ is the motion _diffusivity_ (scalar) field.

 The diffusivity field determines how the motion of the boundary patch is
 distributed throughout the domain. The value for diffusivity is determined by
 specifying a diffusivity model via the
 `displacementLaplacianCoeffs.diffusivity` dictionary:

```foam
displacementLaplacianCoeffs
{
    diffusivity     inverseDistance (cylinder);
}
```

In this case we use the `inverseDistance` model which calculates diffusivity
 based on inverse distance to given patches, which in this case is the
 `cylinder` patch. This means that mesh points farther away from the cylinder
 patch are deformed more, while the cells near to the cylinder act stiffer and
 deform less, this preserving their quality.

As we have selected the `displacementLaplacian` motion solver, the boundary
 conditions for the mesh displacement field should be prescribed in
 `0/pointDisplacement`. The `cylinder` displacement is specified as a rigid body
 motion using the `solidBodyMotionDisplacement` boundary condition:

```foam
boundaryField
{
    cylinder
    {
        type                    solidBodyMotionDisplacement;
        solidBodyMotionFunction oscillatingLinearMotion;

        // \Delta X = amplitude*sin(omega*t)
        oscillatingLinearMotionCoeffs
        {
            // Amplitude (x-direction) of displacement oscillations [m]
            Ax              0.25;
            // Frequency of displacement oscillations [Hz]
            f               0.25;

            // Amplitude vector [m]
            amplitude       ($Ax 0 0);

            // Angular velocity of oscillations [rad/s]
            omega           ${{ 2*pi()*$f }};
        }
    }
    ...
}
```

```note
`Ax` and `f` are user-defined variables here; they are not OpenFOAM keywords but
 are used to calculate `amplitude` and `omega`.
```

For the `left` and `right` patches, a no-slip boundary condition is applied,
 while the `up` and `down` patches use a slip boundary condition.

```foam
boundaryField
{
    ...
    "left|right"
    {
        type    fixedDisplacement;
        value   (0 0 0);
    }
    "up|down"
    {
        type    slip;
    }
    ...
}
```

---

## Running the Case

The case can be run using the included `Allrun` script located in the template
 case (`oscillatingCylinderInChannel/base`) directory:

```bash
# Serial run with default values of environment variables
# Please refer to the top of `./Allrun` to inspect or change the default values
./Allrun

# Specify the mesh density level
# options: $START_MESH <= MESH_LEVEL <= $END_MESH
MESH_LEVEL=4 ./Allrun

# Specify the physics model to use
# options: newtonIcoFluid, pimpleFluid
FLUID_MODEL=pimpleFluid ./Allrun

# Parallel run (currently using `scotch` method)
NUMBER_OF_SUBDOMAINS=8 ./Allrun -p

# Example:
MESH_LEVEL=8 NUMBER_OF_SUBDOMAINS=32 FLUID_MODEL=pimpleFluid ./Allrun -p
```

or by executing the `Allrun` script in the parent `oscillatingCylinderInChannel`
 directory.

```bash
# Serial run
./Allrun

# Parallel run (currently using `scotch` method)
PARALLEL=8 ./Allrun
PARALLEL=8 NUMBER_OF_SUBDOMAINS=32 ./Allrun
```

The `oscillatingCylinderInChannel/Allrun` script runs multiple cases based on
 the configurations and a range of mesh density level given at the top of the
 script, e.g.

```bash
# Define configurations as space-separated strings
configs=(
    "BASE=base NAME=poly.newtonIcoFluid MESH=POLY PIMPLEFLUID=0"
)
readonly configs
# Description
#     BASE:            name of the base template case
#     NAME:            base name given to each case that is created
#     MESH:            Create a structured quadrilaterial (QUAD or QUAD_GRADED)
#                      mesh, a triangular mesh (TRI) or a polygonal mesh (POLY)
#                      mesh
#     PIMPLEFLUID:     use the pimpleFluid (1) or the newtonIcoFluid (0) models
#
# Example
# configs=(
#     "BASE=base NAME=poly.newtonIcoFluid MESH=POLY PIMPLEFLUID=0"
#     "BASE=base NAME=hex.graded.pimpleFluid MESH=QUAD_GRADED PIMPLEFLUID=1"
# )

# Mesh level (density) range (integer).
declare -i START_MESH=1
declare -i END_MESH=1

# ...
```

The `Allrun` script automates the setup, execution, and post-processing of the
 cases. It creates a unique run directory, iterates over predefined case
 configurations and mesh refinement levels, generates the mesh using the
 `blockMesh` or Gmsh, and selects the fluid model (`newtonIcoFluid` or
 `pimpleFluid`). Simulations are then run in serial (`PARALLEL=0`) or parallel
 (`PARALLEL=1`), while performance metrics are logged using some version of
 `time` utility. Finally, plots of the force coefficients are generated using
 Gnuplot.

## Expected Results

The contour plots at four different time instances, together with the reference
 calculations of Wan and Turek[^wan2006] and Erzincanli et al.[^erzincanli2013],
 show that the $x$-component of the velocity reaches higher magnitudes when the
 cylinder passes through the channel center ($x = 1.1 \;\mathrm m$).
 Furthermore, vortices are formed near the channel corners as well as along the
 upper and lower walls.

<!-- ![TODO(abzrg): ADD FIGURE: CONTOUR PLOT AND STREAM TRACES](placeholder) -->

To compre quantitatively the drag coefficient, $C_{\mathrm d}$, and the lift
 coefficient, $C_{\mathrm l}$, are evaluated against the results reported by Wan
 and Turek[^wan2006]. The comparison shows that the present numerical results
 are visually indistinguishable from those in Wan and Turek[^wan2006].

### Function Objects for Calculating Forces and Force Coefficients

The $x$-axis is defined as the drag direction, with the drag coefficient given
 by
$$
  C_{\mathrm d}
= \frac{2 F_x}{\rho_\infty \mathbf{U}_\infty^2 L_{\text{ref}} L_z},
$$

and the $y$-axis as the lift direction, with the lift coefficient defined as

$$
  C_{\mathrm l}
= \frac{2 F_y}{\rho_\infty \mathbf{U}_\infty^2 L_{\text{ref}} L_z}.
$$

Here, $F_x$ and $F_y$ are the components of the fluid force acting on the
 cylinder in the $x$- and $y$-directions, respectively. $\rho$ is the freestream
 fluid density ($1 \mathrm{kg/m^3}$), $\left|\mathbf{U}_\infty\right| = 2 \pi A
 f$ is the magnitude of the freestream flow velocity relative to the cylinder,
 which in this case is considered to be the maximum velocity of the cylinder
 (while passing through the channel center). $L_{\text{ref}}$ is the reference
 length, which in this case is the cylinder diameter, and $L_z$ is the span of
 the computational mesh in the $z$-direction. Also, $L_{\text{ref}} L_z$ is the
 reference area $A_{\text{ref}}$.

Performing a simple calculation,

$$
|\mathbf{U}_\infty| = 2 \pi f A_{\text{ref}}
                    = 2 \times \pi \times 0.25 \times 0.25
              \approx 0.3927\ \mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1},
$$

$$
p_{\text{dyn}} = \frac{1}{2} \rho_{\infty} \mathbf{U}_\infty^2
               = 0.5 \times 1.0 \times (0.3927)^2
         \approx 0.0771\ \mathrm{Pa},
$$

$$
A_{\text{ref}} = L_{\text{ref}} L_z = 0.1 \times 0.1 = 0.01 \mathrm{m}^2,
$$

$$
\texttt{forceScaling} = \frac{1}{A_{\text{ref}} p_{\text{dyn}}}
                      = \frac{1}{0.01 \times 0.0771}
                \approx 1297\ \mathrm{N}^{-1},
$$

the total fluid forces (in the $x$- and $y$-directions) acting on the cylinder
 are scaled by a factor with units of $\mathrm{N}^{-1}$, in this case, $1927\
 \mathrm{N}^{-1}$, to ultimately yield the force coefficients.

$$
C_{\mathrm{d}} = \texttt{forceScaling}\ F_x,
$$

$$
C_{\mathrm{l}} = \texttt{forceScaling}\ F_y.
$$

To calculate these forces and coefficients, function objects are employed:

- `forces`: computes the three components of the fluid force (and moments) on
  specified patches (here, the `cylinder` patch).
- `forceCoeffs`: computes drag and lift coefficients, as well as other force
  coefficients.

```foam

    forces

        type            forces;

        writeControl    1;
        writeInterval   1;
        log             off;
    }
}
```

```tip
The chosen solver computes these quantities on the fly; however, if the outputs
 are missing, they can be re-extracted after the simulation using: `pimpleFoam
 -postProcess`.
```

The outputs of these function objects are written to the directory
 `${FOAM_CASE}/postProcessing`. The results from the `forces` function object
  are stored in `${FOAM_CASE}/postProcessing/forces/0/force.dat`, and output of
  the `forceCoeffs` function is stored in
  `${FOAM_CASE}/postProcessing/forceCoeffs/0/coefficient.dat`.
